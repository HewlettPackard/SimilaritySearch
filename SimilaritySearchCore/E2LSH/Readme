##Overview
This package implements the optimized method of LSH for a big memory machines.

To achieve this latency and speed-up we employed a number of
optimization techniques: (1) using Blaze [17], an open-source
high-performance C++ based linear algebra library to speed up
hash computations via matrix multiplications, (2) loop
unrolling and vectorization to take advantage of CPU vector
processing capabilities and (3) software prefetching to reduce
cache misses
